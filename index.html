                    <span style="  font-size:11px;color:#ffffff;">Custom Plan is our choice for entry level plans without pre-existing medical condition coverage.

  This plan is good for travel anywhere in the world. The only drawback is the limits for medical expense and emergency medial evacuation coverages are not per person limits - they are policy limits.  That's ok if only one person on the policy but dilutes coverage if there are more than one person.  But overall this is the best value for economy priced plans.</span>
